// This example sketch provides an interactive utility you can use to set the
// I2C addresses for a single Motoron controller or multiple controllers
// connected to the same I2C bus.
//
// After uploading this sketch to your Arduino, open the Serial Monitor
// (from the Tools menu of the Arduino IDE).
//
// The top of the serial monitor contains a box where you can type commands for
// this sketch and send them to this sketch by clicking the "Send" button.
//
// To assign an I2C address to a Motoron, send "a" followed by the address
// (in decimal) while the JMP1 pin of the Motoron you wish to change is
// shorted to GND.  For example, "a17" sets the address of the Motoron to
// decimal 17.
//
// Alternatively, you can send a line that just contains "a" by itself in order
// to have the sketch automatically pick an address for you.
//
// To make the Motoron start using its new address, you can reset it by power
// cycling it, driving its RST line low, or by sending "r".
//
// The "s" command does a simple scan of the bus to see which addresses have
// devices responding.  This can help you make sure you have set up your
// I2C bus correctly.
//
// The "i" command goes further, sending extra commands to detect the Motoron
// devices on the bus and print information about them.  Note that if there are
// devices on your I2C bus that are not Motorons, the commands sent to those
// devices might be misinterpreted and cause undesired behavior.
//
// The "a" and "r" commands use the I2C general call address (0),
// so they might interfere with other devices that use that address, and
// they will not work if you disabled the general call address on a Motoron.
//
// This sketch expects each command to be terminated with a
// line-ending character ('\r' or '\n').  The serial monitor
// automatically sends a line-ending character when you click
// the Send button or press Enter.
